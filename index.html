            <p class="pStyle">
              Hi! My name is Lydia* and though I was raised in rural Northwestern Wisconsin, I currently serve the Hudson Valley, Westchester, New York
              and Danbury, Connecticut area. I've had a love of animals as far back as I can remember. I wasn't able to have dogs growing up and would be so excited to hang out with my friends who were dog parents. Eventually, 
              this developed into me housesitting for them while they were away. Overtime, my business quickly spread by word of mouth. I 
              have been officially running this business for three years although I have many more years of experience 
              than that. </p>
     
              <p class="pStyle"> I spent over a year working closely with a vet at a pet hospital, which has provided me with valuable insight.
              Because I don't have any pets or children of my own, my extremely flexible schedule let's me treat your dogs like 
              the family they are to you, with the upmost care. My past experience has lent me the oppertunity to care for dogs of all ages, sizes, and diet needs for different
              timeframes. My services include activites such as administering pills/topical medications, hair brushing/baths, walks, play and plenty of snuggles. You'll
              be kept updated with pictures often so you can have a carefree time because we both know you won't be able to stop thinking 
              about your furbaby while you're gone. Although, my niche is dog sitting, I can also cater to other pets. Feel free to reach 
              out to me with any questions you might have; I usually respond within the hour. Your pets and I will have so much fun together!</p>

          <p class="pStyle">"Lydia is the sweetest and the best! Constant updates about the walk and the cutest pictures
             of my pup on top of that. He is happy, tired, and stress-free after his walks. I've never seen 
             him nap better when we are not at home (we have a camera to check in on him throughout the day). 
             A million thank yous to Lydia! :)" -Rachel K. (Sohm's Mom)</p>
          <p class="pStyle">"Lydia stays in close touch re: our boy Reacher - pics, updates, questions as needed. Thanks Lyda!

          <p class="pStyle">"Used Lydia to watch my brand new puppy (only had a week) and my older boxer dog. Lydia was fabulous 
          and made the new pup feel loved and well cared for. Lydia was there bright and early and stayed long 
          hours with both dogs -- making sure my house and the dogs were well cared for. Would definitely use her 
          again." -Jaymee S. (Sam and Iaila's Mom)</p>
          <p class="pStyle">"Lydia was super awesome! Our pup Remi was super happy after Lydia stayed with him for the day. 
            She was willing to step in on a moments notice and communicated with us throughout her day with Remi. 
            We will definitely be booking her again!" -Austin N.</p>
          <p class="pStyle">"Lydia has dog sat with me and for me and sheâ€™s a wonderful and caring pet sitter!! I trust her very

          <p class="pStyle">"Lydia arrived on time and took a genuine interest in our dog. We are very happy to have her and look 
            forward to entrusting Lydia with our big guy." -Patti V. (Chevy's Mom)</p>

          <p class="pStyle">Now for the serious business stuff... </p> 
          <p class="pStyle">Payments are due the first day of the stay or drop in visit. I accept CashApp, Venmo, and Paypal. You may also leave behind a check or cash at your home.</p>

          <h3> New Client Requirements: </h3>
          <p class="pStyle"> Each new client must make sure their furbabies are up-to-date on rabies' shots and schedule a Meet N Greet a minimum of 24 hours before the stay to make sure we're a great fit. 
          During this visit I would love to know more about you and your furbaby. Things like: </p>
          <p class="pStyle">What is your pet's schedule or routine? </p>
          <p class="pStyle">What vaccines does your pet have? </p>
          <p class="pStyle">Does your pet need any medication? </p>
          <p class="pStyle">What allergies does your pet have? </p>
          <p class="pStyle">How does your pet interact with other dogs or people? </p>
          <p class="pStyle">What is your pet's favorite toy? </p>
          <p class="pStyle">Are they house trained or crate trained? </p>
          <p class="pStyle">Does your pet have a favorite spot in the yard? </p>

          <h3>Stays</h3>
          <p class="pStyle">Unfortunately, I do not offer boarding services at this time. All stays are done overnight at the client's home. Stays are tailored to your furbabies needs and normal
            scheduled routine. This involves regular feeding, watering, walks, playtime etc. I can also pick up mail, water plants, and bring out trash to the end of the driveway at
          the client's request.</p>
          <p class="pStyle">Stays cost $60 a night with additional pets being a $10 add-on.</p>
          <p class="pStyle">Furbabies under 6 months old start at $70 a night with additional pets being a $10 add-on.</p>

          <p class="pStyle">Holiday weekend stays are $75 a night, Friday through Monday, and resume normal pricing for the rest of the stay.</p>
          <p class="pStyle">Holidays during the week are $75 for the night of the holiday and resume normal pricing for the rest of the stay.</p>
          <p class="pStyle">Drop in visits on a holiday or over a holiday weekend are $40 a visit.</p>
