              Hi! My name is Lydia and though I was raised in rural Northwestern Wisconsin, I currently serve the Hudson Valley, Westchester, New York
              and Danbury, Connecticut area. I've had a love of animals as far back as I can remember. I wasn't able to have dogs growing up and would be so excited to hang out with my friends who were dog parents. Eventually, 
              this developed into me housesitting for them while they were away. Overtime, my business quickly spread by word of mouth. I 
              have been officially running this business for three years although I have many more years of experience 
              than that. </p>
     
              <p class="pStyle"> I spent over a year working closely with a vet at a pet hospital, which has provided me with valuable insight.
              Because I don't have any pets or children of my own, my extremely flexible schedule let's me treat your dogs like 
              the family they are to you, with the upmost care. My past experience has lent me the oppertunity to care for dogs of all ages, sizes, and diet needs for different
              timeframes. My services include activites such as administering pills/topical medications, hair brushing/baths, walks, play and plenty of snuggles. You'll
              be kept updated with pictures often so you can have a carefree time because we both know you won't be able to stop thinking 
              about your furbaby while you're gone. Although, my niche is dog sitting, I can also cater to other pets. Feel free to reach 
              out to me with any questions you might have; I usually respond within the hour. Your pets and I will have so much fun together!</p>

                of my pup on top of that. He is happy, tired, and stress-free after his walks. I've never seen 
                him nap better when we are not at home (we have a camera to check in on him throughout the day). 
                A million thank yous to Lydia! :) </p>

                She was willing to step in on a moments notice and communicated with us throughout her day with Remi.

              <p class="quotesRight">Used Lydia to watch my brand new puppy (only had a week) and my older boxer dog. Lydia was fabulous 
                and made the new pup feel loved and well cared for. Lydia was there bright and early and stayed long 
                hours with both dogs -- making sure my house and the dogs were well cared for. Would definitely use her 
                again. </p>
